                <p>Today, with a face of despair, I walked by the maple trees at the park. I walked with my head dropped low </p>
                <p>when a leaf fell from the tree at my feet.</p>
                <p>The wind swept it away. And I stepped on it. </p>
                <p>A mysterious, unknown force pushed me.</p>
                <p>I fell.</p>
                <p>That year, that leaf I stepped on.</p> 
                <p>That leaf stood for my childhood and my happiness which got slowly washed away and crushed under the stereotypes I had.</p> <p>A crushed leaf.</p>
                <p>It showed the brutality of how I have come to look like a different person, and not who I am inside.</p>
